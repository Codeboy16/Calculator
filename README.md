Calculator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS
I'm building a sleek and responsive calculator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. This project combines the power of Bootstrap for layout and responsive design with Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. The calculator features a user-friendly interface that allows for seamless calculations, all while maintaining a modern aesthetic. With JavaScript handling the functionality, I'm excited to create an efficient tool that is both visually appealing and easy to use!
